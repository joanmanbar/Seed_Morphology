# Seed_Morphology
This repository is intended to have Matlab and Python scripts to measure morphological features in seeds.

## Matlab
The Matlab version has a code for images of festuca seeds that are not touching each other (_Festuca_Seed_Size.m_). This code works best with images 1624 x 2097 at 1200 dpi, however, the script can be modified and adapted to images with different features and seeds. The folder contains two sample images.

## Python
The Python version has a code for images of festuca seeds that are not touching each other (_FSS_) and a second code that handles touching seeds (_FSST_). This code works best with images 2997 x 2622 at 600 dpi, however, the script can be modified and adapted to images with different features and seeds. This version also contains a folder with sample images.
